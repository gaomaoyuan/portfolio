            “A running buddy is more than just someone who runs next to you. A running buddy is someone who pushes you, motivates you and supports you through all the joys and struggles of running,” shares bRUNch Running co-founder Cortney Logan. “A regular friend [might not] always understand the ‘running addiction’ as runners are so often accused of having, but a running buddy understands all too well. They understand the need, the desire, and the passion to run.”
