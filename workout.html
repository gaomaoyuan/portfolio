            Weight training is a common type of strength training for developing the strength, size of skeletal muscles and maintenance of strength.[2] It uses the force of gravity in the form of weighted bars, dumbbells or weight stacks in order to oppose the force generated by muscle through concentric or eccentric contraction. Weight training uses a variety of specialized equipment to target specific muscle groups and types of movement.
